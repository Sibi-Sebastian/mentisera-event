# Deployment Guide for Hosting the Website with PhonePe Payment Integration

## Step 1: Choose a Hosting Provider
Select a hosting provider that supports Node.js applications. Popular options include:
- Heroku
- DigitalOcean
- Vercel
- AWS

## Step 2: Prepare Your Application for Deployment
1. **Ensure Dependencies**: Make sure all dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file.
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information like your PhonePe merchant credentials. You can use a `.env` file or set them directly in your hosting provider's dashboard.

## Step 3: Deploy the Application (Example: Heroku)
1. **Create a Heroku Account**: If you don't have one, sign up at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. **Install the Heroku CLI**: Follow the instructions on the Heroku website to install the CLI.
3. **Login to Heroku**: Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```
4. **Create a New Heroku App**: Run the following command to create a new app:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```
5. **Set Environment Variables**: Use the following commands to set your PhonePe credentials:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set YOUR_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id
   heroku config:set YOUR_SALT_KEY=your_salt_key
   ```
6. **Deploy Your Code**: Push your code to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploying to Heroku"
   git push heroku master
   ```
7. **Open Your App**: After deployment, you can open your app in the browser:
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```

## Step 4: Test the Live Application
Once your application is live, test the payment integration to ensure everything works as expected.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to check the logs for any errors using:
  ```bash
  heroku logs --tail
  ```
- For other hosting providers, refer to their documentation for specific deployment instructions.

This guide should help you get your website hosted with the PhonePe payment integration.
